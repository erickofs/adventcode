## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an event created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz) where participants are presented with a series of programming puzzles to solve each day from December 1st to December 25th. The puzzles cover a variety of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills. To learn more about Advent of Code and participate in the challenges, visit the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to include directories for each year and day of the Advent of Code event. Each day's directory contains subdirectories for different programming languages, allowing contributors to submit solutions in their preferred language.

```
.
└── Year
    └── Day
        ├── Language1
        │   ├── Solution.ext
        │   └── ...
        ├── Language2
        │   ├── Solution.ext
        │   └── ...
